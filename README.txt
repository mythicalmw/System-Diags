To run this script successfully:

Double-click the "System Diagnostics.bat" file. This will
elevate and launch the "System Diagnostics.ps1" script and 
open to the menu.

Press 'a' and the enter key to start the analysis. This may
take up to ten minutes to complete depending on the size of
your memory dump file and the number of errors in the Event
logs. Once this is complete, it should launch the 
Windows_Server_Health_Status.html file in your default web
browser. If not, it should be located at:
C:\Scripts\Reports\Windows_Server_Health_Status.html

To zip the contents of the report folder and save it to your
desktop, run the second option (B) and this will save the
results to your desktop in a zipped folder.
